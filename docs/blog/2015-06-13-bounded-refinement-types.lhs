Some time ago, we saw how [Abstract Refinement Types](http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/haskell/blog/blog/2013/06/03/abstracting-over-refinements.lhs) are used in liquidHaskell to abstract over specific properties or invariants. 
These abstraction significantly increases the expressiveness of the system, while still allowing the SMT solver to carry out verification and inference automatically.

From back then we embarked into using Abstract Refinement Types to 
specify _function composition_, i.e. give function composition a type that 
precisely expresses compositionality of the refinements. 
Turned out that _plain_ abstract refinements are not expressive enough to encode such a 
precise type. 
What was missing was a mechanism to restrict or to _bound_ abstract refinements. 


Today, we will see how bounds in refinements types can be used to 
appropriately type function composition and generally how bounds can be used to
get us out of expressiveness bounds 
of Abstract Refinement Types.

Function Composition
--------------------
Consider the function `compose` that composes its two functional arguments
\begin{code}
compose f g x = f (g x)   
\end{code}

Our goal is to specify a type for compose that precisely captures 
the compositionality of the refinements.

For example, given a function that increases its argument by `1`

\begin{code}
{-@ incr :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 1} @-}
incr x = x + 1
\end{code}

We want to prove that composing `incr` with itself increases the argument by `2`.
\begin{code}
{-@ incr2 :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 2} @-}
incr2      = compose1 incr incr
\end{code}

As a first attempt, we give compose a very specific type that states that
if (1) the first  functional argument increases its argument by `1`, and 
   (2) the second functional argument increases its argument by `1`,
then the result function increases its argument by `2`: 

\begin{code}
{-@ compose1 :: (y:Int -> {z:Int | z = y + 1}) 
             -> (x:Int -> {z:Int | z = x + 1}) 
             ->  x:Int -> {z:Int | z = x + 2} @-}
\end{code}

That was easy, with the above type liquidHaskell does verify that `incr2` 
actually increases its argument by `2`. 
But, there is a catch: 
_The type of `compose1` it too specific_.

If we use `compose1` with any other functional argument, 
for example `incr2` that increases its argument by `2`, 
liquidHaskell will reasonably mark the call site as unsafe:

\begin{code}
{-@ incr3 :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 3} @-}
incr3      = compose1 incr incr2
\end{code}


In any real world application, this super specific type of `compose1` is not acceptable.

An Abstract Type for Compose
----------------------------

Onto abstracting the type of compose we follow the route of [Abstract Refinements][AbstractRefinements]. 
We make a second attempt to type function composition and give 
`compose2` a type that states that 
forall abstract refinements `p`, `q` and `r`
if (1) the first functional argument `f` returns a value that satisfies a relation `p` with respect to its argument `y`, and 
   (2) the second functional argument `g` returns a value that satisfies a relation `q` with respect to its argument `x`,
then the result function returns a value that satisfies a relation `r` with respect to its argument `x`:

\begin{code}
{-@ compose2 :: forall <p :: b -> c -> Prop,
                        q :: a -> b -> Prop, 
                        r :: a -> c -> Prop>. 
                f:(y:b -> c<p y>)
             -> g:(x:a -> b<q x>)
             ->  x:a -> c<r x>
@-}    
\end{code}

With this type for `compose2` liquidHaskell will prove that composing `incr` by itself 
gives a function that increased its argument by `2`:

\begin{code}
{-@ incr2' :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 2} @-}
incr2'      = compose2 incr incr
\end{code}

To do so, liquidHaskell will employ the Abstract Refinement Types inference and guess 
the appropriate instantiations for `p`, `q`, and `r`. 
That is, liquidHaskell will infer that `p` and `q` relate two consecutive numbers 
`p, q := \x v -> v = x + 1`
while `r` relates two numbers with distance `2`:
`r := \x v -> v = x + 2`. 
Thus, at this specific call site the abstract type of `compose2` will be instantiated to 
the concrete type we gave to `compose1`. 
And, verification of `incr2` will succeed.


What is the catch now? 
In this second attempt we abstracted the type of `compose2` too much!
In fact, LiquidHaskell cannot prove that the body of `compose2` satisfies its type, just because it does not.

\begin{code}
compose2 f g x = let z = g x in f z
\end{code}

By the precondition of `compose2` we know the result refinements of the functional arguments `f` and `g`. 
From the type of `g` we know that `z` satisfies `q` on `x`, i.e. `q x z` holds.
Similarly, from the type of `f` we know that `f z` satisfies `q` on `x`, i.e. `q x z` holds.

With these, liquidHaskell needs to prove that the result `f z` satisfies `r` on `x`, i.e., `r x z` holds.
The required property `r x z` is not satisfied for _arbitrary_ abstract refinements `p`, `q` and `r`, but only for ones that satisfy a _chain property_ that states that for all `x`, `y` and `z`, if `q x y` and `p y z` holds, then `r x z` holds:

<br>

`\ x y z -> q x y ==> p y z ==> r x z`

Bound Abstract Refinements by the Chain Property
------------------------------------------------

We made two attempts to type `compose`. 
The first one "failed" as our type was unrealistically specific. 
The second failed as it was unsoundly general. 
In our third and final attempt 
we give `compose` a type that is abstracted over three abstract refinements `p`, `q` and `r`. 
But, this time the three refinements are not arbitrary: 
they are bounded to satisfy the chain property.

We encode the chain property as a boolean Haskell function:

\begin{code}
chain :: (b -> c -> Bool) -> (a -> b -> Bool) 
      -> (a -> c -> Bool) ->  a -> b -> c -> Bool
chain p q r = \ x y z -> q x y ==> p y z ==> r x z
\end{code}

Then we use the new liquidHaskell keyword `bound` to lift the 
`chain` function into the a logical bound that
can be used to constrain abstract refinements

\begin{code}
{-@ bound chain @-}
\end{code}

The above bound annotation defines the bound `Chain` that is used as a 
constraint that relates the abstract refinements `p`, `q` and `r` 
in the type signature of `compose`

\begin{code}
{-@
compose :: forall <p :: b -> c -> Prop,
                   q :: a -> b -> Prop, 
                   r :: a -> c -> Prop>. 
           (Chain b c a p q r)
        => (y:b -> c<p y>)
        -> (z:a -> b<q z>)
        ->  x:a -> c<r x>
@-}    
\end{code}

This type of `compose` is both sound and general enough, 
as now we can easily prove that composing `incr` with `incr2` 
results in a function that increases its argument by `3`.

\begin{code}
{-@ incr2'' :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 2} @-}
incr2''      = compose incr incr

{-@ incr3'' :: x:Int -> {v:Int | v = x + 3} @-}
incr3''      = compose incr2'' incr
\end{code}


Conclusion
----------
We saw how bounds in refinement types allow us to specify a 
precise and general type for function composition. 
Bounds in refinement types are (haskell typeclases-like) constraints 
that constraint the abstract refinement variables to specify certain properties.

We note that liquidHaskell desugars bounds to unbounded refinement types, 
thus verification is still performed decidably using the power of the SMT solvers.

Moreover, function composition is not the exclusive user of 
Bounded Refinement Types. 
On the contrary, we used Bounded Refinement Types 
to verify a variety of code, from list-filtering to relational databases.
